Back notes (2019/05/10 - 19:31)

-User signup working, it doesn't create the user in the types table

-Guard login working, we must define what the token encodes.
-Guard signout not working at all

-Address doesn't use token, must check what to do, but it saves a customer direction
 I think that it could be better if save an address for a user is completed by a transaction in the user model and controller
 because it's all about that(save the user address, not just the address).

-Restaurant doesn't use token, but it doesn't really do anything
check all the methods in this place
